= JDBC Statistics =
The JDBC Statistics driver adds statistics to the jdbc connection. 
SQL Strings are normalized with configurable patterns. This
package needs the JDBC Decorator Implementation bundeld in the lib
directory.

== How to use ==
 * Put the jdbc-statistics-x.x.jar and the jdbc-decorator-x.x.jar into your
java classpath so they are loaded on startup.
 * configure your jdbc connection:
  * add jdbcdecorator: before your jdbc url
  * use at.fpmedv.jdbc.StatisticsDriver as driver for your SQL Connections
 * add -Djdbcstatistics.configuration=/PATH/TO/PROPERTIES.FILE to your java command line

A sample jdbcstatistics.properties file is included.

Since I'm a helma developer I added a small lib that outputs the statistics. Just look
at the helma subdir.
