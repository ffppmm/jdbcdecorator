= JDBC Logger =
The JDBC Logger adds statistics and logging to the jdbc connection. 
SQL Strings are normalized with configurable patterns. This
package needs the JDBC Decorator Implementation bundeld in the lib
directory.

== How to use ==
 * Put the jdbc-logger-x.x.jar and the jdbc-decorator-x.x.jar into your
java classpath so they are loaded on startup.
 * configure your jdbc connection:
  * add jdbcdecorator: before your jdbc url
  * use at.fpmedv.jdbc.LoggingDriver as driver for your SQL Connections
 * add -Djdbclogger.configuration=/PATH/TO/PROPERTIES.FILE to your java command line

A sample jdbclogger.properties file is included.

We strongly recommend to use log4j. Just put the log4j.jar from the lib 
directory into your classpath, so it gets loaded on startup, and you are done.

Since I'm a helma developer I added a small lib that outputs the statistics. Just look
at the helma subdir.
